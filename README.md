# Blender Drive & Transfer
A tool for batch-fitting of meshes to a list of blend-shapes, as well as a means to automatically link identically named blendshapes to a base-mesh.

## Instructions
After installing the addon, select the objects you're looking to link, ensuring that your active selection is the base object containing the blendshapes you'd like to combine. Then, head into the Object menu and click on either "Link Shapes," or "Transfer Shapes."
